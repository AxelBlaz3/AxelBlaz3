### Malicious URL Prediction using DNN

- **Description**: Introducing a powerful Deep Neural Network (DNN) that utilizes LSTM to predict the legitimacy of a given URL, distinguishing between legitimate websites and phishing attempts. Notably, this prediction is made quickly without the need to view or analyze the web content. The DNN incorporates two hidden layers, consisting of 128 LSTM units each, followed by a dense layer with sigmoid activation. Remarkably, this model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 96%.
- **Technologies**: _Python, Tensorflow, Deep Neural Networks, Pandas, Numpy, and Data wrangling_.
